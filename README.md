## Description
Repository of all the deliverables developed for the course in KTH: ID2222 in Data mining, part of the Double Degree Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, Data Science & Distibuted Systems track @EIT Digital.

The course deliverables are 5 labs implementing some Data Mining techniques to deal with large datasets. They are developed using Python or pyspark.

**Labs**
* `Lab1 - LSH`: LSH Document Similarity implementation using 10 scientific papers sample corpus
* `Lab1 - MinHashing & AssociationRules`: AssociationRules algorithm implementation including Apriori algorithm
* `Lab3 - HyperBall`: HyperBall technique for approximated node centrality calculation implementation. From paper [HyperBall](http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/HyperBall.pdf)
* `Lab4 - GraphSpectra`: Graph Spectral Clustering technique implementation
* `Lab5 - JABEJA`: JABEJA (swap) algorithm for minimization of ratio cut in partitioning large graphs into similar dimensionality clusters
